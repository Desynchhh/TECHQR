Oxygen is lethal for people over 80, says 40 yearlong study
New research shows that elderly over the age of 80 years old, can decrease their life expectancy by 30 years, if they continue to breathe oxygen.
Researchers at Upton hill University studies the effects of oxygen on the human body over the span of 40 years and found that the elderly have a
severe reaction to it.
“They simply die much faster than the younger subjects.” Dr. Robert Miller states. It was found that people between the ages of 20-30,
have a life expectancy of nearly 30 years, while people above 80 can expect only 5-10 years.
“Until we have a better alternative, we must simply accept this depressing fact.” Dr. Miller continues, “I suggest the elderly simply limit their
breathing to 2-3 breaths a day, its all we can do for now.”
In cooperation with the researchers of Upton hill, several elderly care centres have worked to decrease the amount of oxygen in the air. 
“If they take in less oxygen, they can expect nearly 5 more years of life, than if they took in the usual amount.” States the leader of Evergreen
Elderly Care, Martin Andrews. 
Until we can find a replacement for oxygen, we must simply live with breathing this toxic gas.
